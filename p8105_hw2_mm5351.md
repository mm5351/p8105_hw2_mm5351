*Problem 1* Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet: specify the sheet
in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows with notes /
figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in read\_excel use
reasonable variable names omit rows that do not include
dumpster-specific data round the number of sports balls to the nearest
integer and converts the result to an integer variable (using
as.integer)

``` r
##Read and clean Mr. Trash Wheel data
trash_data =
   readxl::read_excel("./Data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N338") 
trash_data = janitor::clean_names(trash_data) 

##Omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
drop_na(trash_data, dumpster)

Read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018. For each, omit rows
without precipitation data and add a variable year. Next, combine
precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable (the
variable month.name is built into R and should be useful).

``` r
##Read and clean 2017 precipiation data
precip2017_data = 
  readxl::read_excel("./Data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 

##Omit rows without precipiation data and add variable year
drop_na() %>% 
mutate(
  year = 2017)  

##Read and clean 2018 precipiation data
precip2018_data =
  readxl::read_excel("./Data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
##Omit rows without precipiation data and add variable year
drop_na() %>% 
mutate(
  year = 2018)  

##Combine datasets
precipfull_data = 
  left_join(precip2017_data, precip2018_data, by = "month") %>% 

##Convert month to character variable
mutate(
  month = as.character(month.name))
precipfull_data %>% view()
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in both resulting datasets,
and give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the
total precipitation in 2018? What was the median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017?

In the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, there are 336 rows and 14 columns. Each
row represents data for a different dumpster, and many of the columns
depict the type of trash found in the Inner Harbor of Baltimore. For
example, between 2014 and 2018, there were 1.6835410^{6} plastic
bottles, 3.0868810^{7} cigarette butts, and 1.21313110^{6} grocery bags.
The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 12. The
total number of trash collected was 2804.82 tons, which was incinerated
and made to power 3.585210^{4} homes.

In the combined precipiation dataset for 2017 and 2018, there are 12
rows representing each month of the year and 5 columns for month, year
2017, total precipation for year 2017, year 2018, and total precipiation
for year 2018. The total precipiation for 2017 was 32.93. This compares
to the total precipiation for 2018, which was 23.5. Part of the
difference lies in the fact that 2017 had data for 12 months, whereas
2018 only had data for 7 months.
