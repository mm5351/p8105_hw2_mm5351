*Problem 1* Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet: specify the sheet
in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows with notes /
figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in read\_excel use
reasonable variable names omit rows that do not include
dumpster-specific data round the number of sports balls to the nearest
integer and converts the result to an integer variable (using
as.integer)

trash_data = janitor::clean_names(trash_data)  

##Omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
drop_na(trash_data, dumpster)

Read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018. For each, omit rows
without precipitation data and add a variable year. Next, combine
precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable (the
variable month.name is built into R and should be useful).

``` r
##Read and clean 2017 precipiation data
precip2017_data = 
  readxl::read_excel("./Data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 

##Omit rows without precipiation data and add variable year
drop_na() %>% 
mutate(
  year = 2017)  

##Read and clean 2018 precipiation data
precip2018_data =
  readxl::read_excel("./Data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
##Omit rows without precipiation data and add variable year
drop_na() %>% 
mutate(
  year = 2018)  

##Combine datasets
precipfull_data = 
  left_join(precip2017_data, precip2018_data, by = "month") %>% 

##Convert month to character variable
mutate(
  month = as.character(month.name))
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in both resulting datasets,
and give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the
total precipitation in 2018? What was the median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017?

In the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, there are 336 rows and 14 columns. Each
row represents data for a different dumpster, and many of the columns
depict the type of trash found in the Inner Harbor of Baltimore. For
example, between 2014 and 2018, there were 1.6835410^{6} plastic
bottles, 3.0868810^{7} cigarette butts, and 1.21313110^{6} grocery bags.
The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8. The total
number of trash collected was 2804.82 tons, which was incinerated and
made to power 3.585210^{4} homes.

In the combined precipiation dataset for 2017 and 2018, there are 12
rows representing each month of the year and 5 columns for month, year
2017, total precipation for year 2017, year 2018, and total precipiation
for year 2018. The total precipiation for 2017 was 32.93. This compares
to the total precipiation for 2018, which was 23.5. Part of the
difference lies in the fact that 2017 had data for 12 months, whereas
2018 only had data for 7 months.

*Problem 2* First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to
break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day;
replace month number with month name; create a president variable taking
values gop and dem, and remove prez\_dem and prez\_gop; and remove the
day variable.

``` r
##Read and clean pols-month.csv data
polsmonth_data = 
  read_csv("./Data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
##Separate "mon" into integer variables year, month and day. Replace month number with month name
separate(col = mon, sep = "-", into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>%  
mutate(
  year = as.integer(year),
  month = as.integer(month),
  day = as.integer(day),
  month = month.name[month],

##Create a president variable taking values gop and dem
  president = prez_dem + prez_gop
) %>% 

##Remove prez_dem, prez_gop, and the day variable
select(everything(), -prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
##Read and clean data in snp.csv
snp_data = 
  read_csv("./Data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 

##Arrange according to year and month; year and month as leading columns
separate(col = date, sep = "/", into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>% 
mutate(
  month = as.integer(month),
  day = as.integer(day),
  year = as.integer(year),
  month = month.name[month]
) %>% 
select(everything(), -day) %>% 
  arrange(year, month, close)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

*Problem 3* Load and tidy the data. Note that, although these data may
seem fairly well formatted initially, the names of a categorical
predictor and the case structure of string variables changed over time;
you’ll need to address this in your data cleaning. Also, some rows seem
duplicated, and these will need to be removed (hint: google something
like “dplyr remove duplicate rows” to get started).

Produce a well-structured, reader-friendly table showing the rank in
popularity of the name “Olivia” as a female baby name over time; this
should have rows for ethnicities and columns for year. Produce a similar
table showing the most popular name among male children over time.

Finally, for male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016, produce a
scatter plot showing the number of children with a name (y axis) against
the rank in popularity of that name (x axis).

``` r
##Read and clean popular baby names csv
babynames_data = 
  read_csv("./Data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    childs_first_name = str_to_upper(childs_first_name),
    ethnicity = recode(ethnicity, "ASIAN AND PACI" = "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER"),
    ethnicity = recode(ethnicity, "BLACK NON HISP" = "BLACK NON HISPANIC"),
    ethnicity = recode(ethnicity, "WHITE NON HISP" = "WHITE NON HISPANIC")
  ) %>% 

##Remove duplicated rows
distinct() %>%   
  
##Make table showing rank in popularity of name Olivia over time
  select(everything(), -count) %>% 
  filter(gender == "FEMALE", childs_first_name == "OLIVIA") %>%  
  
pivot_wider(
  names_from = year_of_birth,
  values_from = rank,
)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),
    ##   Count = col_double(),
    ##   Rank = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
##Make table showing most popular name among male children over time
babynames_data = 
  read_csv("./Data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    childs_first_name = str_to_upper(childs_first_name),
    ethnicity = recode(ethnicity, "ASIAN AND PACI" = "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER"),
    ethnicity = recode(ethnicity, "BLACK NON HISP" = "BLACK NON HISPANIC"),
    ethnicity = recode(ethnicity, "WHITE NON HISP" = "WHITE NON HISPANIC")
  ) %>% 
distinct() %>%   
select(everything(), -count, -ethnicity) %>% 
filter(gender == "MALE", rank < 11) %>% 
  
pivot_wider(
  names_from = year_of_birth,
  values_from = childs_first_name
)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),
    ##   Count = col_double(),
    ##   Rank = col_double()
    ## )

    ## Warning: Values in `childs_first_name` are not uniquely identified; output will contain list-cols.
    ## * Use `values_fn = list(childs_first_name = list)` to suppress this warning.
    ## * Use `values_fn = list(childs_first_name = length)` to identify where the duplicates arise
    ## * Use `values_fn = list(childs_first_name = summary_fun)` to summarise duplicates
